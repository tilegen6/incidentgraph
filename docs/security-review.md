# Security review — v1.0.1

Scope: application code, API access boundaries, browser behavior, local/container configuration, npm dependencies, repository history and GitHub security settings. Tests use synthetic data and isolated local/CI instances. No third-party production systems were targeted.

## Repository review

Gitleaks was run against all reachable Git history with redacted output. No credentials matching its rules were found. GitHub's secret-scanning alert list was empty at review time. The public login/password strings in the original demo were intentional fixtures, not business credentials; they are no longer accepted in private mode. There was no finding requiring secret rotation at an external provider or a destructive history rewrite.

Generated administrator/database passwords, local environment files, snapshots and scanner reports remain outside Git. Screenshots come from an isolated synthetic test dataset. A scan result is evidence for the checked revision, not a guarantee that future commits cannot contain private data.

## Remaining boundaries

This application has one administrator account, one workspace and one API process. It does not implement SSO/MFA, per-user roles, tenant isolation, encryption at rest, database retention, a distributed abuse defense, or a hardened internet-facing deployment. The local Docker network assumes a trusted host. Infrastructure administrators can inspect environment variables and data volumes.

The deterministic incident-analysis engine is not a security monitoring or attack detection service. An independent penetration test and a deployment-specific threat model remain appropriate before handling real business data.
